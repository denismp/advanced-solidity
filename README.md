# advanced-solidity
Exercises: Solidity Advanced In this lesson, we learned about functions, modifiers, events, contracts, interactions, error handling and libraries in Solidity programming language. The goal of this exercise is to get practical skills in writing advanced smart contracts in Solidity, publishing and testing contracts in the Remix IDE.

Problem 1.	Receiving Funds from the default contract function
Create a Deposit contract which:
•	Stores the owner of the contract
•	People can deposit ethers in the contract
•	People can get the balance of the contract
•	Owner can send amount
o	Upon sending, the contract self-destructs with the total amount in the contract
Use modifiers where it is appropriate.
Add appropriate events for the functions.
